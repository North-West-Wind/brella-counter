      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to NorthWestWind's Brella Counter. This is where I count how many Brella players I have encountered in Splatoon 3.
        They are so rare and precious, so I must cherish every one of my encounters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>At the top of the page is today's Brella rate. </span> 
        As I play at least 2 hours of Splatoon 3 every day on stream, I would like to know how many Brella players I have seen today.
        The "rate" is simply the amount of Brella players divided by the amount of games of the day. Note that this is not counting myself.
        The 4 columns after that (or 4 rows on mobile) is the <span>count of individual Brella types spotted.</span>
        <span> Followed by that is the total count of Brella players I have matched with and games I have played, </span>
        and <span>how many of them appeared on which team.</span>
      </p>
  
      <h3>How is this possible?</h3>
      <p>
        I use stat.ink, and I have a program setup that automatically uploads my match results to the website.
        If you are interested in my profile, you can <a href="https://stat.ink/@NorthWestWind/spl3">check it out here</a>.
        The backend behind this website is just adding new match data every 5 minutes, and the website will update accordingly.
      </p>
